## About Talk

**Meetup Group**: DevOps Malmö

**Date**: Thu, Nov 17, 2022

**Topic:** How to Operate a Secure Kubernetes Platform

**Abstract:**<br/>
In this talk, Cristian presents the top four reasons why orgs struggle to adopt Kubernetes. First, he discusses how to set a scope to ensure that the right skills are allocated to the right task, as opposed to creating an opaque “DevOps” department. Second, he presents how to properly alert and foster the right alerting culture to avoid “alert fatigue”. Third, he talks about disaster recovery training. Even the worst incident needs a way out. Finally, Kubernetes clusters too often run versions which no longer receive security patching. Therefore, the talk concludes with good maintenance habits.

At the end of the talk, you will be able to operate a Kubernetes cluster which meets even the most stringent data protection regulations, such as GDPR and Swedish Patient Data Laws. It is suitable both for newcomers and experienced teams which want to get their Kubernetes operations to the next level.

**Bio:**<br/>

When coming out of the clouds, Cristian works out by playing with his two daughters.
